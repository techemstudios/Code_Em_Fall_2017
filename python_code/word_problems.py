# Word Problems
# Demonstrates numbers and math
# notices the "\n" use and what it does
# shows the operations you can use in python and their examples

# Operator  Description                 Example     Evaluates To
# +         Addition                    7 + 3       10
# -         Subtraction                 7 - 3       4
# *         Multiplication              7 * 3       21
# /         Division (True)             7 / 3       2.333
# //        Division (Integer)          7 // 3      2
# %         Modulus                     7 % 3       1

# the modulus operator produces the remainder of an integer division expression.
# two foward slashes (\\) represents integer division -division where the result is always an integer (any fractional part is ignored).
