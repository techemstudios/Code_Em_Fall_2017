# Let's pull out the values for some of the keys in repo_dict at # ** A ** above.


# At ** A **, we print out values for several keys from the first repo's dictonary.

# Let's summarize the top repositories at ** B ** above.
    # When making avisulaization for this data, we probably waant to include more
    # than one repo. So, we'll write a loop to print selected information about each
    # of the repos returned by the API call so we can have them all 'visualized'.
