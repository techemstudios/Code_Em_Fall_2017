# Code Em  

### Fall 2017  

### Sept 19 - Dec 12  

Initial slides to be used found in [reveal-deck](https://github.com/techemstudios/code_em_fall_2017/tree/master/reveal-deck), in slides-code-em.html --check the latest version. 

*Note:* The content for each section and day below, as well as possible times of each lesson will continuously be populated. The times for each lesson will update with "real" times after each class.    

### Performance Objectives  

By the end of Code Em, students will -  
* Understand computational thinking, or think like a computer scientist  
* Understand how hardware and software communicate  
* Be comfortable interpreting/creating programs to solve problems  
* Learn enough Python to be "dangerous"  
* Explore Python, Java, HTML, Lua programming languages  
* Be comfortable using the Slack messaging app  
* Have all projects from the session on their own GitHub account  

### Day One  

`09/19/2017`  

**Introductions:** Share name, age, grade, and programming experience.  
*5-10min*

### How to Think  
#### Like a Computer Scientist  
*10min*  

Take a problem that at first, may seem overwhelming, or not "attackable" with a program, then break the problem into smaller manageable problems where we can use computation to solve. See how the smaller problems together make up the larger one. Think about computational thinking as useful ways to approach and solve problems using these steps: decomposition, generalization, recognize patterns, make plan (or algorithm) and carry it out. Example, Clean the Whole House problem.

### Get on Same Page  
*5min*  

We have returning students, as well as new students. We will do a little review first and help eachother to become equally confident with coding.  

### GitHub & Slack  
*10min*

Each student will create their our own GitHub and Slack accounts. For those who already have both, make sure they can log in and have them help their peers get set up. Students will use their GitHub account to keep track of all their progress. There should be a time set towards the end of each class to have every student push their code to their own repository. Slack will be used to communicate with one another by asking questions, input, etc. Record student emails, to send slack invitations; record GitHub usernames, to invite to slackbot repo.

### What are Computers?

### Quick Computer History  

*5-10min*

Early computers were tools (or mechanical devices) people used to help them calculate math problems. A modern computer is a device that can be programmed to perform a task. From Talley Sticks, to the Babbage Machine --end with Ada Lovelace, recognized as the first computer programmer.  

Difference between hardware and software.   

What is a computer program?  

#### Quick Review  
Computers are devices for manipulating information we can put info into a computer, and it can transform the info into new, useful forms. Computer can then output or display the information.  

A program is a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform some kind of action, or a set of commands that tell the hardware in a computer what to do.

### Making Programs for the Computer  

#### Python  

* Interpreter  
* Input Text  
* Output Text  
* Data Types  
* Variables  

### Fetch, Decode, Exectute  

#### How a Program Works    

Software communicating with the hardware. CPU, RAM, and what happens when you fire up your favorite program. Fetch: the computer gets the instructions and puts them in RAM; Decode: instructions are decoded into binary so the CPU can understand them; Execute: CPU carries out those instructions. The computer speedily performs this process continuously from the moment you turn on your computer, to the moment you turn it off.

### Expressions & Statements  

Expressions: combination of values, variables and operators, a value or variable all by it self.  

Statements: a unit of code that does something, like creating a variable or displaying something --a complete thought.  

We saw this earlier when we typed an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluated it, which means it finds the value of the expression and returns the result. When you type in a statement, the interpreter executes it, meaning it does whatever the statement says.  

### Day Two    

`09/26/2017`  

### Variables & Strings  

### User Input
#### I/O  

### Computational Thinking  

Useful ways to approach and solve problems --not just problems involving programming, but every problem! 


### Layers of a Computer System  
#### Abstraction  

When we are working in one layer, we do not need to concern ourselves with the information in the surrounding layers. This way, we can just focus on what needs to be done in the moment. Think of abstraction as a mental model; a way to think about something. Have the unnecessary details hidden, so we can leave only the information we need to complete our goal.  

Abstraction Examples:  

* A Person Driving a Car  
  - The only thing they need to focus on is the road ahead. 
  - It is unnecessary to worry about details of how the engine or electornics of the car work.
  
* Fast Food Restaurant  
  - 


### Functions  
#### Think Abstraction: Encapsualtion  

Test Jupyter Notebook lesson.  

Close look at the parts of a function statement.  

### Day Three    

`10/03/2017`  

### Case Study

#### Interface Design with the Turtle Module  

**Objectives**  

* modules  
* methods  
* for loops  
* Defining Functions  
* arguments & parameters  
* Computational Thinking  
  - Pattern Recognition: Encapsualtion: **DRY**    
  - Generalization  
* Refactoring  

#### The Software Development Process  

Following a process for writing your programs will help you to be more efficient and help you reach your goals. When you need to create a large program, it can be a daunting challenge and almost impossible without a systematic approach.  

#### Computer Hardware History  

Engineers are concerned with building things to be more efficient.  

**Objectives**  

* Pick up from Babbage machine  
* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Gen  
* Components  
* vacuum tubes  
* transistors  
* microchips  
* Desktop computers
