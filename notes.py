# 9/19
	# skipped expressions & statements
	# ended with variables (msg.py)
		# Might be best to stay in terminal together for longer (Quicker responses)
		# Move from terminal when functions/oop start

# 9/26
	# Took way to long to configure GitHub accts
		# Next time, send instructions to do at home
	# went over expressions, statements, variable and string concatenation
	# one successful git push!
	# start on user input next week

	# create student github with EZ credentials for the few who are having trouble with configuring GitHub accts.
		# Have those clone/push to this repo.

# 10/3
	# New student
	# Review what we learned so far via the interpreter
	# handling input from the user intro
		# store input
		# challenge: output something "sensible" with the input from user
	# Still, slow progress. Likely need to break up into groups.


# 10/10
	# Ada Lovelace day: review, who was she. What is today about?
	# Introduce Computational Thinking -clean whole house problem
	# Abstraction: Look at layers of a computer system
	# Functions: built-in functions we've used: print(), input()/raw_input()
		# Code block
		# passing arguments to a function, arguments
		# Encapsulation: another example of Abstraction
			# test it out by creating a function with a variable inside, then try to call the variable when outside
def hello():
	name = raw_input("tell me your name: ")

print name
	# Case Study: Interface Design with turtle
	# draw a write angle using turtle 'methods';
	# challenge: add instructions to make a complete square
		# introduce for loop
		# stopped before while loop and creating a square function

		# majority of class is having trouble knowing exactly what to type
		# though, the content is on the slides. May be best to display Python GUI
		# on tv screen to walk through the programs, rather than slides.  

# 10/17
	# Turtle Graphics (Case Study-style)
	# driving home the idea of giving instructions to computer to do something
		# right angle
		# full square
		# for loop intro to complete square
		# create your own function --> "encapsulation"
		# generalize the function to highlight code reusability "generalization"

# 10/24
	# brainteaser (Day 6)
		# testing competence in basics:
			# fire up a python program
			# kick off complete thoughts
			# general cs
		# challenge to create a simple calculator program using turtle graphics to draw answer
		# quick slackbot intro --> to dive in fully next week

# 10/31
	# Halloween (no class)
		
# 11/07
	# 

# 11/14
	# temp humidity program
		# challenge: make your own temp warnings
	# slackbot code_em: push first changes to repo, then test sirexa

	# only four weeks left... likely jump to OOD

	# break up class into groups based on skill level to get more done

# 11/21
	# Object-oriented: Turkey class creation!
	# Quick exercise in using matplotlib to visualize fake temperature data

# 11/28
	# graphics.py
		# used graphics.py to draw shapes to screen

# 12/4
	# getting mouse clicks with graphics.py
	# three clicks make a triangle

# 12/12
	# more faces of computer science: Turing and Hopper
	# find your birthday in the first million digits of pi.py
