# 9/19
	# skipped expressions & statements
	# ended with variables (msg.py)
		# Might be best to stay in terminal together for longer (Quicker responses)
		# Move from terminal when functions/oop start

# 9/26
	# Took way to long to configure GitHub accts
		# Next time, send instructions to do at home
	# went over expressions, statments, variable and string concatenation
	# one successful git push!
	# start on user input next week

	# create student github with EZ credentials for the few who are having trouble with configuring GitHub accts.
		# Have those clone/push to this repo.

# 10/3
	# New student
	# Review what we learned so far via the interpreter
	# handling input from the user intro
		# store input
		# challenge: output something "sensible" with the input from user
	# Still, slow progress. Likely need to break up into groups.


# 10/10
	# Ada Lovelace day: review, who was she. What is today about?
	# Introduce Computational Thinking -clean whole house problem
	# Abstraction: Look at layers of a computer system
	# Functions: built-in functions we've used: print(), input()/raw_input()
		# Code block
		# passing arguments to a function, arguments
		# Encapsulation: another example of Abstraction
			# test it out by creating a function with a variable inside, then try to call the variable when outside
def hello():
	name = raw_input("tell me your name: ")

print name
	# Case Study: Interface Design with turtle
	# draw a write angle using turtle 'methods';
	# challenge: add instructions to make a complete square
		# introduce for loop
		# stopped before while loop and creating a square function

		# majority of class is having trouble knowing exactly what to type
		# though, the content is on the slides. May be best to display Python GUI
		# on tv screen to walk through the programs, rather than slides.
